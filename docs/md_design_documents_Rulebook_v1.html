<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
1. Planeverse</h1>
<p>Our own world is just one plane of existence. There are many other planes, woven together into what called a “Planeverse”. A plane is just another reality in the same space that we call “Universe”. Therefore, the planes can overlap themselves in space. Most of these planes are materialistic, formed in one way or another by the prime elements of nature such as fire, earth etc. Planes are vast, cosmic creations that require astonishing amounts of energy to create and even more to maintain, therefore only gods can form them. Most gods have created their own planes of existence. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
1.1. Planes of existence</h2>
<p>NameDescription Natural PlaneThe primary plane. Birth &amp; death by nature is the base law on this plane. VortexA foggy and lifeless plane that exists between the planes and it's used primarily to connect the planes together. Fiery PlaneThe Fiery plane is a vast sea of flames and smoke, interrupted only by gigantic burnt rocks and coal. Only parties with extreme resistance to fire can withstand this hell of a place. Water PlaneThe Water plane is just a vast sea of unmeasurable depth. There are silent regions with no waves and regions full of whirlpools and titanic waves. Not a place for walking parties. Terra PlaneThe Terra plane is a solid plane made completely out of stone, mud, soil and about any mineral in existence. Even the fact that you can walk through it is because it has been dug down by the plane’s inhabitants. Aerial PlaneThe Aerial plane is a vast, groundless and cloudy place. There's no gravity here and no sense of depth at all.</p><ol type="1">
<li>World The Planeverse is a vast place, although not without rules, at least in the Natural Plane. The party can move, can get hungry, buy stuff, need to rest &amp; there’s a day-night cycle like in real life. All this may sound too obvious &amp; perhaps a time of waste to even consider, but in a CRPG, a set of rules will be required to restrict things in favor of common sense &amp; balance. 2.1. Time The time can be broken down into minutes, hour, day, month &amp; year. There are no different rules than the ones already used in our reality, so 60 minutes makes up an hour, 24 hours makes up a day, 30 days (strict) make up a month &amp;12 months make up a year. Time can be increased through the following ways: •Time is increased by one (1) minute when the party moves •Time is increased by one (1) minute when a player makes a combat action •Time is increased by eight (8) hours when the party performs a long rest •Time is increased by a period when party makes a rest until fully healed •Time is increased by a period when party travels to another map 2.2. Lighting There are various states of lighting in the world environments. Those environments can be either interior (interior) or exterior (etc. forest). Lighting can be modified either by environment (i.e. daylight) or equipment/magic (i.e. torch, spells). Interior areas can provide the following lighting states: •None – Usually encountered in interior areas, such as dungeons. Visibility is really low, allowing up to one (1) visible square before everything gets pitch black. •Normal – Stronger lighting that none. An interior area can be lit for up two (2) visible squares &amp; perhaps more but the rest remains pitch black. Exterior areas can provide the following lighting states: •Day – Very strong lighting. •Night – Strong lighting. 2.3. Movement Moving in the world is very context-related i.e. on dungeon crawlers the movement could be done by grid, one at a time, while on open 3D games there's typically free movement. However, there are some simple rules: •For every movement the party makes, there is also a movement for all monsters, NPCs etc. A creature might prefer to not move on its turn but it always takes a chance to do that. A non-move is also considered a move. •Monsters, NPCs have an initial position i.e. their starting position. They can move randomly or chasing you down i.e. monsters, but they can't movefurther from their initial position after some distance. This keeps monsters, NPCs population in certain places. See below for more information. •Movement is not allowed through objects considered as obstacles. These objects includes trees, monsters, walls etc. General rule is, the party can't move through obstacles, under normal situations. •Movement is not allowed when the party is engaged in a fight i.e. there are monsters in neighbor squares. •Movement to another area is done by traveling (see Traveling). Traveling requires some time (see Time) &amp; food to be completed, which is distance- based. For example, the party may travel to another neighbor area in one (1) day &amp; consume one (1) food ration. If the party has no food left, the traveling can not be done. •Monsters that are far but still in range (visible or not), they're not seeing you yet and will make random, patrolling moves around their initial position. In code that could mean an 80% of your draw distance. •Monsters that are far from their initial position, they stop following you and instead making moves that keeps them in range with their initial position. •Monsters can take one (1) up to four (4) squares in each direction of the party; therefore, up to 16 monsters can surround the party. 2.4. Traveling The world is divided into smaller areas. Each area is, usually, interconnected to a number of other areas. Traveling to an area takes time &amp; consumes food rations, which are context-based. Those areas can be traveled by the party in a number of ways: •The party can travel to a neighbor area on their own, using the roads. The time spent is one (1) day &amp; food consumed is one (1) ration. •The party can travel to non-neighbor area through a traveling service. In this case, the time spent &amp; food consumed is context-based. One way to estimate the time spent is to count the areas the party is traveling through. 2.5. Food A character needs to eat before getting a rest (see Resting), otherwise he won't be able to rest at all; therefore a well prepared party should be the first priority. Food rations can be obtained in several ways but they can usually be found incivilized places such as taverns or traveling merchants. Food can be consumed, by user action or automatically, in the following ways: •Food can be consumed by resting •Food can be consumed by traveling to another map 2.6. Resting Characters spends their entire day fighting though monsters and difficult challenges. Most of the times they end up wounded and tired. An easy (but expensive) way to restore hit points is to use magic or potions. The other way is through resting. A party has 2 options here: •A Long Rest: The party rests for eight (8) hours or less if the party is healed, which may or may not heal the party to full extent. The party consumes one (1) food ration after the healing. Useful when the party needs some fast healing, consuming the least possible food rations. •Rest Until Fully Healed: Here the party rests until all members have full hit points, as well as spell points (for caster professions). This might take more time, especially the more wounded the party is. The party consumes one (1) food ration for every 8 hours the party is rested, round up. Useful when the party is severely wounded, but keep an eye on available food rations. The procedure heals the hit points &amp; restores the spell slots (for caster professions) in a single turn. This is context-based, since this is a timed procedure. A turn may last 5 minutes, as an example or similar timed periods. The spell slots restored on single turn, are added to a single expertise slot at a time, starting from the lowest expertise (that is, initiate) and advance to next expertise when the current expertise spell slots are full! The exact hit points healed &amp; restored spell slots for each character, in each turn, are the following: int amount_hp = random(1, (ToughnessMod / 2)); int amount_sp = random(1, (IntelligenceMod / 2)); 2.7. Currency The monetary system in Planeverse is as simple and straightforward as could be; everything is traded through gold coins. The suffix for an amount of gold coins is simply a g, for example 350g is a valid amount. However, this can lead to some problems if the amount is big enough for expensive objects i.e. selling a house could cost millions of gold. In this case there are two (2) possible solutions: • Format the gold amount with commas i.e. 3420500g becomes 3,420,500g• Use additional suffixes based on amount i.e. 150200g becomes 150.2Kg Specifically: SuffixNameIn gold coinsDescription 1Kg1 Kilogold1,000g1 thousand gold coins 1Mg1 Megagold1,000,000g1 million gold coins 1Tg1 Teragold1,000,000,000g1 billion gold coins</li>
</ol>
<p>3.1. Relation to D&amp;D attributes D&amp;D provides a number of attributes like Strength, Intelligence etc. A close interpretation of D&amp;D attributes and ORS abilities is shown on the following table: ORS ability D&amp;D attributePower The amount of force that muscles can exert against a targetStrength Measuring physical power and carrying capacity Intelligence The ability to logically think &amp; acquiring knowledgeIntelligence Measuring deductive reasoning, knowledge, memory, logic and rationality Personality Charisma The ability to verbally impose, persuade &amp; cope Measuring force of personality, persuasiveness, with conversations leadership and successful planning Toughness The ability to exercise and develop the muscular systemConstitution Measuring endurance, stamina and good health Technique The ability of handling difficult or highly sensitive tasks, by handDexterity Measuring agility, balance, coordination and reflexes Quickness The ability of moving fast &amp; accurately for a short timeDexterity Measuring agility, balance, coordination and reflexes Perception The ability of sensing &amp; coherently interpreting the environmentWisdom Measuring self-awareness, common sense, restraint, perception and insight An easy way to convert D&amp;D attribute values to ORS ability values is to simply multiply each D&amp;D attribute value with 1.5, round up. This is only based to the fact that ORS allows larger ability values. For example: D&amp;D goblin attributes: STR (8), DEX (14), CON (10), INT (10), WIS (8), CHA (8) ORS goblin abilities: POW (12), INT (15), PERS (12), TOU (15), TECH (21), QUI (21), PERC (12) 3.2. Ability modifiers Static ability values by themselves are only used as a starting reference but they've to be converted before they be used in game mechanics, providing bonuses &amp; penalties to a particular ability. A static ability score of 5 is not very useful to game mechanics, however it can be easily understood by humans as it represents steady improvement. Wherever an ability is referenced by its normal name i.e. Intelligence, it indicates its static ability score or the ability in general. When the special word Mod is applied as suffix i.e. IntelligenceMod, it indicates the ability modifier of that particular ability. To compute the ability modifier from a static ability value, one subtracts 20 points from the static ability value, then divide by 2, then round down the number to get the ability modifier value. If instead one prefers a limited table for the first 40 static ability values, the chapter Initial computed values can be used for quick reference. However, in a developed CRPG, the developer has to implement a computation mechanism.3.3. Initial computed values Static ability for 0...23Ability modifierStatic ability for 24...41Ability modifier 5-6-724-25+2 7-8-626-27+3 9-10-528-29+4 11-12-430-31+5 13-14-332-33+6 15-16-234-35+7 17-18-136-37+8 19-21+038-39+9 22-23+140-41+10</p><ul>
<li>static ability values can't go below 5 (see Character creation) 3.4. Generate static ability values A character has to generate seven (7) values to be used as the starting (static) ability values. All (static) ability values are starting at 15 points. You are given 20 ability points at the start to distribute them freely to all abilities. Remember that you can't reduce a static ability value below 5.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Races Characters are sorted into races, which greatly shapes their appearance, code of law, spoken languages, lifespan and other. Those races are: NameLifespanAdulthoodLanguagesAbility Bonus Human~100 years18 yearsEnglish*Intelligence +4 Dwarf~400 years60 yearsEnglish*, DwarvishToughness +4</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>English is a language that every race can speak; its not considered a skill 4.1. Alignment Characters have a personality that drives their actions, every decision &amp; motive. Usually, it is directly connected to real player’s alignment i.e. the one playingthe character. Alignment can be used to greatly change the outcome of a discussion, the course of a quest, the entire party goals and so on. In addition, alignment is not only a party’s feature; it also applies to monsters, farmers &amp; kings out there which can &amp; will have further consequences on everything the party does. Those alignments are: NameDescription GoodGood characters protect the innocent, respect life and value dignity. They keep their word and have strong respect for the law and truth. NeutralNeutral characters are driven by their own causes and they're not get attached to other characters. They can be either Good or Evil on occasion if that helps their cause. EvilEvil characters hurt and oppressing others and have no respect or compassion for others. They strongly disrespect law and prefer lies and trickery, if that helps their causes. 4.2. Languages Characters speaks their own languages based primarily on their race and secondly by choice for a reason i.e. trading, exploring or living in another place. The languages are: NameSpoken byDescription English*Human, DwarfThe most common and oldest language of Natural Plane DwarvishDwarfThe native language of the Dwarves</li>
<li>English is a language that every race can speak; its not considered a skill 4.3. Naming Most races have vastly different culture and ancestry, so it's only logical they have their own naming conventions. One is free however to choose whatever name he thinks about.

<ol type="1">
<li>Professions Characters are also sorted into professions, which is simply their job, what they do. Some fight their way, other are traders and some unravel the mysteries of magic (more commonly, they’re casters). In addition, they get different amounts of initial wealth when they start. These professions are: NameCasterInitial WealthDescription KnightNo120gKnights offer their muscles and weapons for a payday. They can be mercenaries for hire, soldiers or guards in a King's court. Their numbers are always in need so while they're not living a rich life, they still manage pretty well. ClericYes60gClerics are the natural defensive casters of Planeverse. They draw energy by praying to their deities and they can be found in holy places such as Abbeys. They are usually poor and don't have much in wealth. WizardYes180gWizards are the natural offensive casters of Planeverse. They usually found in some laboratory studying spells or old enhanced items. Because they're dealing with expensive jewelry all the time, they usually live a rich life. 5.1. Hit points The hit points is a number that defines the maximum life points i.e. how much damage you can take before getting knockout or worse. The Profession defines primarily a base for the hit points calculation while Race may or may not provide an additional bonus. The following table shows the starting hit points for every profession:ProfessionBase HPHP / Level Knight40 + (5 * ToughnessMod)+6 Cleric28 + (3 * ToughnessMod)+3 Wizard28 + (3 * ToughnessMod)+3 5.2. Spells points Opposite to hit points, spells doesn't have points; instead a fixed number of spells slots (i.e. times to cast a spell) are provided. The ability IntelligenceMod defines the total number of spells a caster can use, sorted by skill expertise. 5.2.1. Expertise The spells, like the weapons, requires some kind of experience or expertise to be used appropriately; the main logic is: • • • • the ability IntelligenceMod defines the total number of spells the total number of spells are allocated per expertise level the lower the expertise, the fewer &amp; weakened spells a caster can use the higher the expertise, the more &amp; stronger spells a caster can use The base expertise levels, which can be used for everything that requires an expertise level i.e. weapons, are the following: Initiate / Apprentice / Adept / Master / Grandmaster Since the total points are divided per expertise level, a spell slot list for a player may look like 10 / 7 / 4 / 2 / 1. This can be broken down to this: • • • • • 10 Initiate spells 7 Apprentice spells 4 Adept spells 2 Master spells 1 Grandmaster spell Obviously, a caster can only cast a spell of given expertise if he's trained in the required skill (see Skills). In addition, when there are no available spells to cast on an expertise, the caster requires some resting (see Resting) to restore his spell slots.5.2.2. Generate spell totals Initially, the spell slots are shared in the following allocation, provided the character belongs to a caster profession, such as a Wizard; if the profession is not a caster, the total number of spells will be zero (0), as well their spell allocation. So, initially, the casters are provided the following spell allocation: 10 / 7 / 4 / 2 / 1 However, the value of IntelligenceMod (see Abilities) can be used to determine the final spell allocation to the different expertise levels. If for example, the Intelligence is 19, this will gives as a IntelligenceMod of 0. We then add that up to the first expertise (Initiate) in the above allocation, which is 10 and we get the total number of Initiate spells. To calculate the total spells of the remaining expertise levels, multiply the current number of spells for the expertise with 70%, then round down to get the final value of the number of spells for the next expertise. The following steps can be used to compute this more easily: • • • • • • If profession is not a caster, give him an initial 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 spell allocation If profession is a caster, give him an initial 10 / 7 / 4 / 2 / 1 spell allocation Compute the ability modifier of Intelligence Apply any racial / profession bonuses to IntelligenceMod Add the final value of IntelligenceMod to the first expertise number Multiply remaining expertise numbers by 70% of previous, rounded down Another example, an Intelligence of 10 computes an IntelligenceMod of -5. Applying this bonus to Initiate starting number of 10 will give 5 and the following sharing (after using the above calculations): 5/3/2/1/0 The above indicates that this caster can only cast 11 spells at the moment, allocated from lowest to highest expertise. However, if he trains hard and raise his Intelligence to 24, he'll get an IntelligenceMod of 2, which it will change his allocation of spell slots to this: 12 / 8 / 5 / 3 / 2 If you instead prefer the spells slots for the first 40 static ability values of Intelligence, the chapter Initial computed values can be used for quick reference. However, in a developed CRPG, the developer has to implement a computation mechanism: 5.2.3. Initial computed values Static ability for 0...23 Spell slots Static ability for 24...41 Spells slots5-63/2/1/0/024-2512 / 8 / 5 / 3 / 2 7-84/2/1/0/026-2713 / 9 / 6 / 4 / 2 9-105/3/2/1/028-2914 / 9 / 6 / 4 / 2 11-126/4/2/1/030-3115 / 10 / 7 / 4 / 2 13-147/4/2/1/032-3316 / 11 / 7 / 4 / 2 15-168/5/3/2/134-3517 / 11 / 7 / 4 / 2 17-189/6/4/2/136-3718 / 12 / 8 / 5 / 3 19-2110 / 7 / 4 / 2 / 138-3919 / 13 / 9 / 6 / 4 22-2311 / 7 / 4 / 2 / 140-4120 / 14 / 9 / 6 / 4 5.3. Strong / weak Abilities Professions have two (2) Abilities that are best suited for those characters. Those Abilities provide an additional bonus to the initial Ability values (static) when a character is created, specifically seven (7) points. There’s also an Ability that is unsuited for that Profession, which causes an additional penalty to the initial Ability value for that Ability by the same amount. Keep in mind that the aforementioned bonuses / penalties are only applied (once) on Character creation procedure. The following table shows those abilities for each Profession: ProfessionStrong abilitiesWeak abilities KnightPower, ToughnessIntelligence ClericIntelligence, PersonalityPower WizardIntelligence, PerceptionPower</li>
<li>Character progression An adventurer's life is full of dangers, exploration and killing, which in turn provides the adventurer with experience. This experience can then be used to reach milestones for a character progression, more commonly named levels in the RPG world. Levels are the natural progression mechanism in the system. To advance in a level, one needs to reach the required experience points for that lever. However, the way characters gains experience vary greatly in this dynamic world. The experience is always shared between live / active members. Dead or paralyzed characters wont get a share of the experience gained. This system uses a (somewhat) complex algorithm to compute the experience required for a given level, which is presented below in the C++ programming language (but can be converted easily to any language): uint32_t experience_required_for_level(double level) { double exp = 0;} for(double x = 1; x&lt;level; x++) { exp += std::floor(x + (300 + (level * 100)) * std::pow(2, (x / 10))); } exp = (std::round(std::floor(exp) / 10) * 10); return (uint32_t)exp; The above mechanism produces reasonable, yet increasingly difficult to reach, levels. At the 1st level you will advance pretty quickly by killing some monsters, but at the 2nd level the advancement will come harder and so on for every level. If instead prefer a limited table for the first 20 levels &amp; experience required, the chapter Initial computed levels &amp; experience can be used for quick reference. However, in a developed CRPG, the developer has to implement a computation mechanism. 6.1. Initial computed levels &amp; experience Level 1...10Experience RequiredLevel 11...20Experience Required 101120960 25401225680 313401331070 424201437210 538201544160 655801651990 777201760800 8102801870670 9133101981710 10168502094020 6.2. Advancing levels by quests Level advancement can be done in various ways and not just by killing monsters. One of such ways is by completing a quest. The XP given may be a fixed value but this poses a balancing problem since characters can be either very weak or very strong for that fixed value &amp; there’s also the difficulty of computing a balanced experience value. The system uses a balanced approach, which is the following: • • • • take the average level of all live / active characters take the experience needed for (average level + 1) multiply by 0.5 that experience share the final experience amount to all live / active characters.Thus, the experience shared will always be balanced. In this case, if only a character is alive / active then he will advance in level by completing two (2) quests. Otherwise, if all characters are alive / active, the party will need to complete eight (8) quests to advance in level, just by completing quests without counting the intermediate killing of monsters or anything else providing XP.</li>
<li>Skills Besides the character's profession, you will need to practice some skills to improve yourself and your party's survival chances. Those skills are sorted into skill groups, which are Weapon, Armor, Magic and Misc (miscellaneous). A character can choose as many skills as he wants, there's no restriction, except the time invested &amp; the amount of money the party will need in order to progress on these skills. That is, advancing into a skill requires serious time &amp; money and there's a standard procedure. This procedure starts with you buying the right to practice a skill for a modest price. At this time you're basically an Initiate, which is not an official recognition of your skill level and therefore you won't be referred as such; it just means you have the right to start your skill progress and work under the wandering Masters, which you need to seek and find them, on your own. This procedure is called qualification and must be done for every expertise you wish to reach in the skill. Each Master have some requirements before promote you to the next level of expertise. These are: • • • • provide a fixed amount of gold gain the required skill level (i.e. Long Blade of 5 skill points) gain the required base ability score (i.e. Power of 20 ability score) train a specific amount of time, along with Master You can't expect to advance to a Grandmaster status at 1st level of your skill just because you're rich, nor without months of intense training. Provided you have the gold, each Master requires to work with him for a fixed period of time; this is done automatically, the Master is just a member of your party and when the party walks, he’s working with you and evaluates your progress. In the end of training, the character is trained to the next expertise level &amp; the Master then leaves the party. The following table lists the expertise levels, with all the advancement requirements: NameDescription <em>InitiateYou just bought a piece of paper, allowing you to practice a skill. Yawn.

<li><em>An initiate in a skill is not referenced as such 7.1. Relation to D&amp;D skills D&amp;D provides a number of skills, associated with an attribute. The D&amp;D attributes relates to skills in the form of applied restrictions, that is, a character can’t acquire / use a skill if he doesn’t have the necessary D&amp;D attribute score for the associated D&amp;D attribute. The exact same mechanism applies to ORS as well. Furthermore, some events require some skill check: •In D&amp;D, challenges provide a Difficulty Class (DC) to be checked against a (related) skill score, which describes the difficulty of the challenge. •In ORS, challenges require a specific Expertise to be checked against a (related) skill expertise, which describes the difficulty of the challenge. In both cases, if the check passes, the challenge is overcome. The character with the highest expertise with said skill is always used. Those skills belong to the Misc group of skills i.e. Lore or Dwarvish (language) are such skills. A close interpretation of D&amp;D DC and ORS expertise checks is shown on the following table: ORS expertiseD&amp;D Difficulty Class (DC)DC to ORS expertise range (1-20) InitiateVery Easy (DC 5)1-4 ApprenticeEasy (DC 10)5-8 AdeptMedium (DC 15)9-12 MasterHard (DC 20)13-16 GrandmasterVery Hard (25)17-20+The DC to ORS expertise range (1-20) column is used to cap D&amp;D DC ranges to an ORS range, which then maps to appropriate ORS expertise. ORS skill scores are not used for checks; only the mapped ORS expertise. Some examples between D&amp;D and ORS challenge checks: D&amp;D DC (12) on a related X skill → ORS Adept expertise on a related X skill D&amp;D DC (19) on a related X skill → ORS Grandmaster expertise on related X skill An example of an ORS challenge check with a party of three (3) characters: ORS challenge requires a check on Lore skill (Expertise required: Adept) • • • • Merlin (Have Lore Expertise at Master level) Amon (Have Lore Expertise at Grandmaster Level; Paralyzed) Selina (Have no Lore skill) Percival (Have Lore Expertise at Initiate level) The ORS chooses the highest expertise among all alive (i.e. no dead) &amp; active (i.e. no paralyzed, maddened etc.). Thus, the higher expertise of the party is that of Merlin (Master). We check his expertise against the expertise the challenge requires, that is, Master vs Adept. Since Master &gt;= Adept, the challenge check is passed and the party overcome the challenge. 7.2. Mapping ORS skills to D&amp;D skills ORS provides fewer skills than D&amp;D does but they do provide more context in general. A rough mapping of ORS skills to D&amp;D skills follows: ORS skillD&amp;D equivalent skill Fitness (Power)Athletics (Strength) Dwarvish (Intelligence)- Lore (Intelligence)Arcana, History, Religion (Intelligence) Persuasion (Personality)Deception, Persuasion, Intimidation (Charisma) Taming (Toughness)Animal Handling (Wisdom) Quickhand (Technique)Sleight of Hand (Dexterity) Stealth (Quickness)Stealth (Dexterity) Awareness (Perception)Perception, Survival (Wisdom) 7.3. Benefits and restrictions A high expertise should provide some benefits in opposite to lower expertise. This is handled differently for each skills group (Weapons, Magic etc.). The followingtable shows the benefits / restrictions for each expertise for each skill group: Skill group Weapon Armor Magic Misc Benefits / Restrictions ExpertiseDescription InitiateCan use weapons of +0 only (no modifier at all) ApprenticeCan use weapons of +1 as well AdeptCan use weapons of +2 as well MasterCan use weapons of +3 as well GrandmasterCan use weapons of +4 as well InitiateCan use armors of +0 only (no modifier at all) ApprenticeCan use armors of +1 as well AdeptCan use armors of +2 as well MasterCan use armors of +3 as well GrandmasterCan use armors of +4 as well InitiateCan use Initiate spell scrolls only Can use Initiate spell books only ApprenticeCan use Apprentice spell scrolls as well Can use Apprentice spell books as well AdeptCan use Adept spell scrolls as well Can use Adept spell books as well MasterCan use Master spell scrolls as well Can use Master spell books as well GrandmasterCan use Grandmaster spell scrolls as well Can use Grandmaster spell books as well InitiateInitiate expertise skill check ApprenticeApprentice expertise skill check AdeptAdept expertise skill check MasterMaster expertise skill check GrandmasterGrandmaster expertise skill check 7.4. List Everything you can wear, use or fight with is considered a skill on its own and making the best out of it will determine your fate. The following table shows the base skills, the expertise level that each profession may attain to and all the fine details that fully characterizes a skill. Skills that have a - rather an expertise level are not allowed for this Profession. Some skills require another skill to be learned first. For example Chained armor can't be used unless Leather armor is learned to Adept expertise. This requirement is only used when you are trying to learn a skill. Finally, someskills, especially of the Misc group, may have different rules for learning. For example, languages are either learned or not; only one trainer is required to advance you to the Grandmaster status.

Character progression in skills Skills need to be developed by frequent use for the character to improve their use &amp; efficiency. Characters gets experience in skills when they use them (mostly), the same way their character level progresses. A skill consists of: • • • the level the experience the expertise Initially, an acquired skill is set to level 1, experience at 0 and expertise of Initiate. Each time a character uses an acquired skill through an item or action, the skill experience is advanced by one (1) experience point. Each skill belongs to a specific group, indicating their use method to gain experience. Those skill groups are: •Weapon – Involves skills such as Short Blade, Long Blade, Pole etc. Experience comes by using weapons in a battle. •Armor – Involves skills such as Shield, Chained Armor, Plated Armor etc. Experience comes by getting hit / miss by a monster while wearing armor. •Magic – Involves skills such as Fire Magic, Water Magic etc. Experience comes by using magic in a battle. NOTE: Magic can used through staffs, wands, scrolls etc.• Misc– Involves skills such as Dwarvish (language), Lore etc.. Experience is here is very context-based. A convenient method of gaining experience on such skills is by utilizing items such as Books or similar methods. For example, reading a Book on Lore should improve one’s skill experience, provided he’s initiated on that skill. If a skill reaches a specific level, the character might be eligible to advance his expertise on this particular skill. The chapter Skills shows the skill requirements for a character to advance his expertise. This system uses a (somewhat) complex algorithm to compute the experience required for a given skill level, which is presented below in the C++ programming language (but can be converted easily to any language): uint32_t experience_required_for_skill_level(double level) { double exp = 0; for(double x=1;x&lt;level;x++) { exp += std::floor(x + (150 + (level * 5)) * std::pow(2, (x / 10))); } exp = (std::round(std::floor(exp) / 10) * 10); return (uint32_t)exp; } The above mechanism produces reasonable, yet increasingly difficult to reach, skill levels. At the 1st level you advance somewhat quickly by using the skill, but at the 2nd level the advancement will come harder and so on for every level. If instead prefer the full table for the 20 levels &amp; experience required, the chapter Initial computed skill levels &amp; experience can be used for quick reference. However, in a developed CRPG, the developer has to implement a computation mechanism. 7.6.

<li>Combat Planeverse is a very dangerous place &amp; hostile encounters can show in literally every step. A battle occurs when hostile characters (humans, monsters, things etc.) gets too close to the party. The battle is progressing through mutual actions, based on specific statistical computation (see Combat order). The battle ends when either party or the hostile characters are dead. 8.1. Combat order When you are next to monsters, a combat order must be computed i.e. in which order the combatants are taking actions. The ability used to determine the combat order is Quickness, which used for both party and monsters. The value of QuicknessMod is always used. The procedure of determining the combat order is quite straightforward: •First verify that you're facing monsters in close encounter of some direction i.e. front, back, left or right. regardless of your orientation. •Compute the QuicknessMod for all, both party and monsters. •Sort combatants by their QuicknessMod, in descending order. The combatants are acting based on combat order. They can use both items on their hands in one turn i.e. if you have 2 swords in your hands (single-handed), you can use both before ending your turn or you can just skip one or both hands to next combatant in order (which can be another party member or an enemy). When a party member uses one of his hands, this hand can't be used again in current turn. In addition, item equipping is limited while you're engaged in a fight (see Equipping items in combat). When all combatants ends their turn, a Movement (see Movement) is initiated and combat order repeats itself. 8.2. Equipping items in combat When the party is engaged in a combat, their number of actions are limited. One of such actions is equipping items. A character can only equip an item under the following conditions: • • It’s his turn to act One of his hand slot has not been used For example, if a character has a Longsword on his right hand and has used it to attack, he can not swap it with some other item while he is pondering the use of his (unused) left hand. However, an unused hand can be swapped with some otheritem such as weapon, a healing potion or a spell scroll. The list is an example, any item can be swapped as long the basic rules of equipping apply i.e. a 2-handed weapon can not be equipped even if the other hand has already been used. 8.3. Damage The damage is a measurement of how powerful is an offensive item, such a weapon or a spell. It is usually not fixed since damage can be affected by a number of factors, including simple luck. Another important point is that damage is hardly just a matter of muscle; there is a number of damage types and only some of them involve raw power. For each kind of damage a specific procedure is followed to compute the final damage: 8.3.1. Damage by Bare hands If there's no weapon in hand i.e. the attack is made with bare hands (melee attack), then only PowerMod score is considered as a damage. The target’s Protection is considered as defence. To ease the calculations below, we assume a target with no protection at all (Protection = 0). For example a Wizard with Power score of 14 decides to attacks with his bare fists. To compute the final damage: PowerMod = compute_ability_bonus( 14 ) // PowerMod is -3 (Power 14) finaldamage = PowerMod finaldamage -= target_protection if (finaldamage &lt; 0) { finaldamage = 0 } Thus, the resulted damage its 0. That is, the target successfully absorbed the attacker’s damage. Another example, a Knight with Power score of 24 (+2) attacks. To compute that final damage: PowerMod = compute_ability_bonus( 24 ) // PowerMod is +2 (Power 24) finaldamage = PowerMod finaldamage -= target_protection if (finaldamage &lt; 0) { finaldamage = 0 } That is, Knight deals a damage of 2. Obviously, only very strong characters (or very weakly protected targets) would be able to cause decent damage with their fists or a character provided with strong enhancements. 8.3.2. Damage by Melee weapons Melee weapons are any handheld weapons that can be used in hand-to-hand battle. Typical melee weapons include swords and flails. When attacking with amelee weapon, the Power ability is primarily used, then the item’s offensive capability is considered. Melee weapons usually provide their damage in a from / to range. The target’s Protection is considered as defense. To ease the calculations below, we assume a target with no protection at all (Protection = 0). For example a Knight with Power score of 24 (+2) decides to attacks with his Long sword (melee weapon, belonging to Long blade skill). To compute the final damage: PowerMod = compute_ability_bonus( 24 ) // PowerMod is +2 (Power 24) finaldamage = PowerMod finaldamage += random(weapon_damage_from, weapon_damage_to) finaldamage -= target_protection if (finaldamage &lt; 0) { finaldamage = 0 } // if item is enchanted and cause elemental damage(s): loop (item_enchantments) { if (enchantment_cause_elemental_damage) { damage = random(elem_dmg_from, elem_dmg_to) if (target_vulnerable_to_elemental_skill) { damage *= 2 } if (target_resistant_to_elemental_skill) { damage /= 2 } finaldamage += damage } } if (target_vulnerable_to_item_skill) { finaldamage *= 2 } if (target_resistant_to_item_skill) { finaldamage /= 2 } if (item_has_doubledamage_enchant_vs_monster_type) { finaldamage *= 2 } Things to consider: • • • • A melee weapon can be enchanted (see Named enchantments), which may cause elemental damage(s). If the target is vulnerable to the melee weapon’s skill, that is Long Blade, it will receive double damage. The damage will be halved if the target is resistant to weapon’s skill. If the melee weapon is enchanted by double damage vs type, the target will receive double damage. 8.3.3. Damage by Ranged weapons Ranged weapons are any weapons capable of engaging targets at a distance. Typical ranged weapons include bows and crossbows. When attacking with a ranged weapon, the Technique ability is primarily used, then the item’s offensive capability is considered. Ranged weapons usually provide their damage in a from / to range. The target’s Protection is considered as defense. To ease the calculations below, we assume a target with no protection at all (Protection = 0). For example a Knight with Technique score of 24 (+2) decides to attacks with his Bow (ranged weapon, belonging to Bow skill). To compute the final damage: TechMod = compute_ability_bonus( 24 ) // TechMod is +2 (Technique 24) finaldamage = TechMod finaldamage += random(weapon_damage_from, weapon_damage_to) finaldamage -= target_protectionif (finaldamage &lt; 0) { finaldamage = 0 } // if item is enchanted and cause elemental damage(s): loop (item_enchantments) { if (enchantment_cause_elemental_damage) { damage = random(elem_dmg_from, elem_dmg_to) if (target_vulnerable_to_elemental_skill) { damage *= 2 } if (target_resistant_to_elemental_skill) { damage /= 2 } finaldamage += damage } } if (target_vulnerable_to_item_skill) { finaldamage *= 2 } if (target_resistant_to_item_skill) { finaldamage /= 2 } if (item_has_doubledamage_enchant_vs_monster_type) { finaldamage *= 2 } Things to consider: • • • • A ranged weapon can be enchanted (see Named enchantments), which may cause elemental damage(s). If the target is vulnerable to the ranged weapon’s skill, that is Bow, it will receive double damage. The damage will be halved if the target is resistant to weapon’s skill. If the ranged weapon is enchanted by double damage vs type, the target will receive double damage. 8.3.4. Damage by Magic Magic damage can come from any item capable of casting offensive spells. Typical magical items include staffs, wands and scrolls. When attacking with a magical item, the Skill level of magic spell is primarily used. However, there are cases where the caster isn’t initiated in the magic skill the spell belongs to. For example, a Knight may cast a fire-based spell by using a wand, without actually be initiated in Fire magic, which would be impossible for a Knight profession. Initially, the non-caster professions (such as Knight) have a skill level of 0 when they cast a spell. However, internally they’re provided by skill level of 1 to be able to cast, albeit with the lowest effect. The same happens when the profession is a caster but not initiated in the magic skill the spell belongs to. Magical items provide their damage in a from / to range. However, this damage is further modified by the caster’s skill level in the magic skill the spell belongs to. The target’s Resistance to the spell’s skill is considered as defense. However, this is computed differently if the target is a monster or the party. Magical damage is also capped to the skill’s expertise (i.e. Initiate, Apprentice…), which results in a max damage. Finally, some spells may cause a non-elemental damage as well. The target’s Protection can be used as defense in this case. To ease the calculations below, we assume a target with no protection at all (Resistance = 0). For example a Wizard with Fire magic skill level of 1 decides to attacks with a Firebolt spell (a fire-based spell, belonging to Fire magic skill). To compute the final damage: expertise = 0 // 0 = Initiate, 1 = Apprentice... if (not_a_caster) { skill_level = 1 } // non-casters are always level 1if (not_initiated) { skill_level = 1 } // casters missing the magic skill starting_skill_level = (expertise = * 5) // used to cap the magic damage if (skill_level &gt; starting_skill_level + 5) { skill_level = starting_skill_level + 5 } finaldamage = 0 loop (skill_level times) { finaldamage += random(spell_damage_from, spell_damage_to) } // target is a monster if (target_vulnerable_to_spell_skill) { finaldamage *= 2 } if (target_resistant_to_spell_skill) { finaldamage /= 2 } // target is a party's character finaldamage -= target_resistance if (damage &lt; 0) { damage = 0 } if (spell_causes_nonelemental_damage) { damage = 0 loop (skill_level times) { damage += random(spell_nonelem_dmg_from, spell_nonelem_dmg_to) } damage -= target_protection if (damage &lt; 0) { damage = 0 } finaldamage += damage } Things to consider: • • • If the target is vulnerable to the ranged weapon’s skill, for example, Fire magic, it will receive double damage. If the target is resistance to weapon’s skill, for example Long Blade, it will receive half damage. Magic damage can also be non-elemental. In this case, Protection will be used as a defense. 8.3.5. Damage by Action While party characters are usually act through their equipped items such as swords or staffs, monsters act through actions. A monster may have one or more actions to use on his turn against the party. Their effects are various and related to the monster in question. For example, a Goblin may possess an action named Broad Axe (dealing physical damage) while a Dragon may possess an action named Fire Breath (dealing elemental damage). Some actions may look like they’re dealing with an item (ex. Broad Axe) but they’re not related to ORS items at or with an action with the same name of diffferent monsters. For example, a Dragon may possess an action named Bite that deals X physical damage. However, a Wolf may also possess an action named Bite that deals Y damage. Just because they have the same name, doesn’t mean they’re dealing the same damage. Each action’s properties are exclusive to its monster.Actions can deal physical damage (against a character’s Protection) or elemental damage (against a character’s specific Resistance) or cause a condition. The current properties of an action follows (see Monster List for monster actions): To compute the final damage of an action: finaldamage = 0 variant = 0 if (action_cause_physical_damage) { dmg_from = floor(action_physical_dmg_from) dmg_to = floor(action_physical_dmg_to) // filter by monster’s variant float perc = (1.0f + (float)variant * 0.15f); dmg_from = round(action_physical_dmg_from * perc) dmg_to = round(action_physical_dmg_to * perc) // final damage finaldamage += random(dmg_from, dmg_to) finaldamage -= target_protection } if (action_cause_elemental_damage) { dmg_from = floor(action_elemental_dmg_from) dmg_to = floor(action_elemental_dmg_to) // filter by monster’s variant float perc = (1.0f + (float)variant * 0.15f); dmg_from = round(action_physical_dmg_from * perc) dmg_to = round(action_physical_dmg_to * perc) // final damage finaldamage += random(dmg_from, dmg_to) finaldamage -= target_resistance } if (finaldamage &lt; 0) { finaldamage = 0 } Monster variants There are some monsters that have improved variants from the original monster, like Goblin → Goblin Warrior etc. These improved variants shows an improved damage on the same actions (when the action is offensive, like the action Broad Axe of Goblin). Not only these stronger variants have increased level and hit points, but they hit harder with the same actions. The calculation is based on the original action, provided by the original monster (first). On the code above, variant = 0 really means the original monster; replace with variant = 1 (stronger than original), variant = 2 (stronger than variant = 1) and so on. If a monster doesn’t have variants, just leave it as variant = 0.</li>
<li>ConditionsA condition (mostly negative) is caused usually by a spell, environment or character choices. Its intention is to inflict direct or indirect damage to a character's statistics for as long the condition lasts or until its cured. The base conditions are: NameDescription DeadA dead character's hit points has reached 0 or less and can't take actions (immobilized) until he's raised back to life. Rest of conditions are removed. CAUSE: hit points reduced to 0 or less. CURE: spells and temple visits. PoisonedA poisoned character has reduced Power, Personality, Toughness, Technique, Quickness, Perception by 25% and increased Earth resistance by 100%. <em>Each action loses 2% of maximum hp. Resting while poisoned leads to certain death. CAUSE: monster actions, traps, potions. CURE: spells, potions and temple visits. FlamedA flamed character has reduced Personality, Technique and Perception by 50%, increased Quickness by 50% and increased Fire resistance by 100%. *Each action loses 5% of maximum hp. CAUSE: monster actions, traps. CURE: spells, potions and temple visits. ParalyzedA paralyzed character can't take actions (immobilized). CAUSE: monster actions, traps. CURE: spells, potions and temple visits. FrightenedA frightened character has reduced Personality, Quickness, Perception and Mental resistance by 50%. CAUSE: monster actions, spells, events. CURE: spells, potions and temple visits. MaddenedA mad character has reduced Personality by 100%, increased Power, Quickness by 50% and increased Mental resistance by 100%. He also randomly attacks party members (*per-turn), causing a damage of 5% of his maximum hp. CAUSE: monster actions, spells. CURE: spells, potions and temple visits. ExhaustedAn exhausted character has reduced Power, Technique, Perception by 50% and reduced experience gained by 50%. CAUSE: party has not rested for a day. CURE: rest, spells, potions and temple visits. CursedA cursed character can't restore his HP/SP (restless) while resting. CAUSE: monster actions, spells. CURE: spells, potions and temple visits.</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Actions are counted in per-turn basis. Such actions are party movement and combat turns. In addition, there’s a 50% chance to cause those effects (per-turn). NOTE: if the entire party becomes one of: Dead, Paralyzed, Maddened the game ends. 9.1. Chance to inflict conditions Computing the chance for inflicting a condition is straightforward and is used forboth party and monsters: condition_chance = floor(chance + (attacker_level / 4)) For example, if a character casts a spell that have 10% chance to inflict the Flamed condition, he will instead have 16% chance if he is on level 25. 9.2. Reduce the condition chance by Ability Some conditions provide a way to reduce the chance to get inflicted by using an ability such as Power for example. In this case, the condition chance, set by both condition and attacker’s level, is further subtracted by the provided AbilityMod, multiplied by 2: condition_chance -= (AbilityMod * 2) For example, a character have a Power of 25 (+2) and got hit by a condition-based attack, with a chance of 40% of causing the condition, the ability to reduce that chance is Power and the attacker level is 25. Based on attacker’s level, the chance rises to 40 + (25 / 4) = 46%. However, the PowerMod of defender is 2, which updates that final chance to 46 – (2*2) = 42% 9.3. Inflict conditions by items Some enhanced weapons can cause conditions i.e. a special long sword may be infused with poison effect to cause Poisoned condition when it hits its target. In addition, the weapon must deal a damage before causing a condition as well. 9.4. Inflict conditions by spells Some spells are causing conditions i.e. a the Flamed condition. The formula takes into consideration the caster's level only, therefore the higher the caster's level, the more his chance to cause conditions with his spells. Some spells have higher initial condition chances which leads to high chance if the caster is high leveled. NOTE: if a spell causes damage as well, then a condition can only be caused if the spell actually caused some damage. If an offensive spell misses, there is no chance for a condition effect to be used. This is not a requirement for non-offensive spells.9.5. Inflict conditions by actions The formula used for spells is also used in actions to cause conditions. The only difference is that an action must deal some kind of damage for the condition to apply. If an action is supposed to deal some damage but it missed, either by target's protection or resistances, even a successful condition check can't be applied. For example, a giant rat's Bite action is supposed to cause the Poisoned condition and is supposed to deal damage. However, it won't be able to cause anything if it misses. 9.6. Resistances There are many types of damage types out there: physical, magical, elemental and more. Furthermore, there are conditions that can get inflicted by absence of some resistance. A character may be strong enough to withstand raw power but can die in agony in few hours by getting Poisoned through a spider bite. This kind of damaging, called elemental damage, requires more planning since the typical Protection of a character (usually provided by armor, boots etc.) wont help much against since they’re only protecting against physical damage. Fortunately, there is a way to reduce the effects of such damage types; by improving the other kind of character protection; the resistances. They’re specifically: ResistanceDescription FireProtects against the element of fire i.e. dragon breaths, spells like Firejolt etc. AirProtects against the element of air such as cold, lightnings, thunders etc. WaterProtects against water and ice related attacks. EarthProtects against earth based attacks such as poison, stone and acid. EnergyProtects against pure non-elemental magical energy MentalProtects against attacks that cause mental effects such as confusion, insanity etc. SoulProtects against attacks that cause aging, divine spells etc. 9.7. Relation to D&amp;D resistances D&amp;D provides a number of damage types such a Fire, Cold etc. A close interpretation of D&amp;D damage types and ORS resistance types is shown on the following table: ORS resistance typeD&amp;D damage type FireFireAirCold Thunder WaterCold EarthPoison Acid EnergyForce Lightning MentalPsychic SoulRadiant Necrotic ProtectionSlashing Piercing Bludgeoning</em></li>

<li><em>Monsters Monsters are the natural inhabitants of the wilderness. Some of them are intelligent, other are not but all of the them have a purpose and their location is never random. Some of them guard a fortress, others are hired for protecting some place, others are magically constructed by some mad wizard, others may came from another plane etc. Every monster has a specific set of attacks. Those attacks are defined by weapons, spells &amp; actions. 10.1. D&amp;D challenge rating to monster level ORS system provides levels for monsters. However, D&amp;D provides a Challenge Rating (CR) for its monsters, which is, as the name suggests, the difficulty to kill a monster. The maximum CR for D&amp;D is 30, while the level cap in ORS system is 100. An easy way to convert a D&amp;D monster’s CR to ORS monster level is to multiply the CR with 3.3, round up. monster_level = std::ceil(CR * 3.3) Some examples: D&amp;D Goblin (CR: ¼) → (¼) * 3.3 = Level 1 D&amp;D Troll (CR: 5) → (5 * 3.3) = Level 17 10.2. Compute Hit Points for monster To compute the hit points for a monster, two (2) need to be known, its level &amp;its toughness. First, multiply its level by 5 and add to initial hit points. Then, perform a somewhat complex formula add to total hit points: hp = (monster_level * 5) hp += ceil(0.4f + (floor(monster_level * (Toughness * 0.4f)) * 0.125f)); Some examples: Goblin (Level 1, Toughness 15) → 7 HP Goblin (Level 5, Toughness 15) → 30 HP 10.3. List Notice that monsters doesn’t have skills and, obviously, skill levels. As a result, they don't have an expertise as well. In any case an action requires a skill level or expertise i.e. spells, the monster's level is used as a skill level and the spell's base expertise is used instead. Monsters belong to a type, have a Level (which defines its HP), a fixed Protection (which is defined by either a natural armor or by equipped items), a Toughness (which adds to its HP), a Quickness (which defines its initiative in battle), a number of one-liner Actions (which can use in combat) and, optionally, a number of Resistances &amp; Vulnerabilities (which can alter the damage they receive). Actions that cause a condition provide all the necessary information (the condition, the chance of causing it and the ability to reduce that chance by the defender). Keep in mind that chance is further modified by attacker’s level (see Chance to inflict conditions) and by defender’s ability, related to this condition (see Reduce the condition chance by Ability). Actions are defined by a number of properties: •Target This can be either 1 (one character) or N (all characters) •Reach Either S (short reach; only when on front-rank) or L (long reach; on all ranks) •Damage Can be either physical (Ph) or elemental (eX), where X can be one of the F/A/W/E/N/M/S, each one for an element, like F = Fire. Example: Ph:1-2 NOTE: For the increased damage, dealt by improved monster variants (i.e. Goblin Warrior), see Damage by Action. •Condition Condition can be defined by providing the first 2 characters, like De = Dead, Po = Poisoned and so on. There’s also the chance to cause the condition (ex: 40%), as well as the ability used to reduce that chance.The base monsters are: NameTypeLV HP Pro Tou Qui Actions</em></li>

<li>Each resistance &amp; vulnerability refers to a skill 10.4. Experience The monster's experience to give is computed by weighting all of its properties in a predefined way. Starting with its Level, we use the following simple formula: XP = (Level * 25) That is, a monster of Level 14 will give an experience of 350, at this point. Next, we consider its Protection and Quickness with the following formula: XP += (Protection * 2) XP += (Quickness * 2) As well, a monster with Protection of 10 will give 20 experience. Finally, a monster with Quickness of 8 will give 15 experience. Next, we consider its Number of actions with the following formula: XP += (number_of_actions * 25) That is, a monster with Number of actions of 2 will give 50 additional experience.Finally, we consider its Resistances with the following formula: XP += (number_of_resistances * 10) That is, a monster with resistance to Bludgeon and Earth Magic will provide 20 additional experience.</li>

<li>Items Items are very versatile and can be used differently by profession or not at all, for example a spell book item can't be used by non-casters such as Knights and a regular Longsword can't be used by a caster. However, all items have common elements such as name, body part to be worn and value. In addition, most items have improved versions which are more efficient, as well costing more and are rarer to find; those items have a plus + symbol next to their name, for example an item named Longsword +1 it's an improved version of Longsword. 11.1. Equipping One needs to have an expertise in the weapon’s skill before using it, otherwise the item can not be used / equipped. In addition, items belong to specific body parts; that is, most of the items have to be worn in a specific body part when they're equipped to be used correctly. For example, a Longsword is a weapon that belongs to the hand and unless it's not equipped there, it can't be used. However, they can be placed anywhere in inventory, although not used then. In addition, you can't equip an item while you're engaged in a fight. The following table shows the body parts, some example items that belongs there and how many instances of that body part exist in a character: Body partItemsNumber HeadHelmet1 NeckAmulet1 ShoulderCloak1 ChestPlate mail1 ArmGauntlets1 HandLongsword2 FingerRing4 FeetBoots111.2. Enchantments Some items have magical features, called enchantments. Those enchantments are providing the wearer effects such as Power or Hit Points increase or decrease, as long as the wearer have those items equipped. Such items are the staffs, which provides the wearer i.e. a caster, with a permanent bonus of Intelligence, as long as they hold the staff. A rule of thumb is that an enchantment can increase / decrease temporary any of character’s statistics. 11.2.1. Mode of calculation The effects an enchantment provides to a statistic can be computed with the following modes. The same enchantment can work differently though item because the mode of calculation used is different. The following list shows the calculation modes, along with a description &amp; the formula used: NameDescriptionFormula* Fixed valueApplies directly to statisticstatistic = statistic + effect EfficiencyUses the efficiency bonus i.e. +1 statistic = statistic + (effect * (efficiency) + 1) % of valueUses % of provided valuestatistic = statistic + ((effect / 100) * value) % of stat totalUses % of statistic total valuestatistic = statistic + ((effect / 100) * stat total) NameSelf-describes the enchantmentBy context RangeRandom select from 2 numbersUsed supplementary with other modes DoubleDoubles the effectUsed supplementary with other modes</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>statistic = the current &amp; final value of character’s statistic after the calculation, effect = the value indicated by the enchantment i.e. Power +2, stat total = the total value of a character’s statistic i.e. not current or filtered 11.2.2. Named enchantments Enchantments can also be grouped under a common name that indicates their purpose. This named group may have one or more enchantments, providing an arsenal of enchantment effects to the wearer of item. Items may or may not be infused with a named enchantment. By default, only one named enchantment may infuse the item and inform players about. However, an item may further enchanted by multiple enchantments. In such case, the context of the game decides the correct way to present the item’s various enchantments to the player. All items can get infused by an enchantment except items that are defined by magic or have a single use such as wands, books, scrolls &amp; potions. The following tables shows the named enchantments, along with the effects they provide, the mode which are using for calculating the effect &amp; the list of item types on which canbe infused: NameEffectModeAllowed of Protection+5 ProtectionEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Fire Resistance+5 Fire ResistanceEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Water Resistance+5 Water ResistanceEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Earth Resistance+5 Earth ResistanceEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Energy Resistance+5 Energy ResistanceEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Mental Resistance+5 Mental ResistanceEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Soul Resistance+5 Soul ResistanceEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Health+10 HPEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Life+1 HP / <b>turnEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Greater Life+10 HP, +1 HP / **turnEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Power+2 PowerEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Intelligence+2 IntelligenceEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Personality+2 PersonalityEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Toughness+2 ToughnessEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Technique+2 TechniqueEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Quickness+2 QuicknessEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Perception+2 PerceptionEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Fire Damage1-4 Fire DamageRange, EfficiencyWeapon of Air Damage1-4 Air DamageRange, EfficiencyWeapon of Water Damage1-4 Water DamageRange, EfficiencyWeapon of Earth Damage1-4 Earth DamageRange, EfficiencyWeapon of Energy Damage1-4 Energy DamageRange, EfficiencyWeapon of Mental Damage1-4 Mental DamageRange, EfficiencyWeapon of Soul Damage1-4 Soul DamageEfficiencyWeapon of Knights+2 Power, +2 ToughnessEfficiencyWeapon, <em>Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Clerics+2 Intelligence, +2 PersonalityEfficiencyWeapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Wizards+2 Intelligence, +2 PerceptionEfficiencyWeapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Wizardry+4 Intelligence, +4 PerceptionEfficiencyWeapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Cavalier+2 Personality, +2 TechniqueEfficiencyWeapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Shadow+2 Technique,EfficiencyWeapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet,+2 Quickness Staff, Ring of Giant+2 Toughness, +2 ProtectionEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Titan+4 Toughness, +4 ProtectionEfficiency*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Hydra+2 Toughness, +1 HP / **turnEfficiencyWeapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Scholar+10% Experience gained% of value Weapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Savant+25% Experience gained% of value Weapon, *Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of Animalsx2 damage vs AnimalsDoubleWeapon of Oozesx2 damage vs OozesDoubleWeapon of Demonsx2 damage vs DemonsDoubleWeapon of Elementalsx2 damage vs Elementals DoubleWeapon of Dragonsx2 damage vs DragonsDoubleWeapon of MedicineImmune to PoisonedName*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of HumidityImmune to FlamedName*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of MobilityImmune to ParalyzedName*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of CourageImmune to FrightenedName*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of LogicImmune to MaddenedName*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of InvigorateImmune to ExhaustedName*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring of BlessingImmune to CursedName*Armor, Cloak, Amulet, Staff, Ring</em></b></li>
<li><b><em>Armor here includes the types: Armor, Shield, Gauntlets, Helmet &amp; Boots ** Stat affections apply 50% of the time when applied on per-turn basis 11.3. Worth Some items are more expensive than other because are constructed by specific components, which can be either common or rare and require different expertise for their making. All item types have a base worth that shows how much this item is worth initially. 11.3.1. Worth by evolution Evolved versions of item are built upon base worth to increase the item worth. The formula to calculate the worth of an evolved item is the following, rounded up: worth_evolved = (base worth * (1 + (2.50 * evolved level))) For example the weapon Longsword has a base worth of 50g; an evolved version of it like Longsword +1 will increase its worth to (50 * (1 + (2.5 * 1))) = 175g.11.3.2. Worth by property The item can break down into its properties such damage on weapons, protection on armors, magic on amulets etc. Each property and amount of it increases the item's worth. Note that some items provides one or more of these properties; for that reason we don't deal with item types here rather properties themselves. The following table shows the worth per property type &amp; amount: PropertyWorthExample +1 damage2g2-4 damage = 12g +1 protection2g8 protection = 16g +1 enchantment affection, valued4g+4 Power = 16g +1 enchantment affection, named15gPotion of Cure Poison = 35g +1 named enchantment50gof Protection = 50g 11.3.3. Worth by spell If item contains a spell i.e. wands, the expertise of spell and also its number of charges are used to define the additional price. The formula to calculate the additional worth of a spell-contained item is the following: worth_spell = (((expertise + 1) * 5) * number_of_spell_charges) The above equation assumes that expertise is a number from 0...n, where the first (0) means the Initiate expertise and gets increased from then. Since this rulebook is all about CRPGs, it’s game developer duty to implement this mechanism. 11.4. List In the following content, the base items are presented. Base means that those items are the basis for other, more specialized versions. Those specialized versions may differ in efficiency, including added effects. However, they will always share the basic properties of the item, the skill, the usable body part etc. 11.4.1. Weapon Weapons are the primary tool to cause damage to your foes and there's a large variety of them. Each weapon has one or more improved variations thatincreases damage as the Efficiency increases; that is, an improved version of a weapon is stronger that previous. Some weapons starts slow, then increased rapidly in much improved versions, others are already somewhat strong from the start but they doesn't improve a lot.

Misc Finally, there are items that couldn’t be placed into any of the aforementioned categories, mostly because their features vary a lot. Most of these don’t have any relation to each other but they still can be quite common in the world and/or provide common abilities, while on occasion share some some abilities with all common-type items referred in previous chapters. Finally, such items are more open to interpretation, for example Torch has 24 turns before burning out.

<li>Spells Spells are the workhorse of casting professions such as Wizards and Clerics i.e. Knights can't cast spells. A caster can cast a spell with various methods such as using his Staff (i.e. not quarterstaff), a Scroll or a Wand. For a caster to cast a spell using a staff, the spell must be learned first by using a spell book. In addition, caster is required to learn the particular magic skill first i.e. to even learn a fire-based spell one has to learn the Fire magic skill first. Some spells can't be used by some casting professions. They're sorted primarily by their expertise because of the varied amount of energy required for casting and secondly by profession. 12.1. Relation to D&amp;D spell levels D&amp;D provides a number of levels, specifically nine (9) levels per casting class, which levels is a general indicator of how powerful the spell is. ORS uses descriptive expertise levels i.e. Master, rather numeric ones. A close interpretation of D&amp;D spell levels &amp; ORS expertise levels is shown on following table: ORS expertise levelD&amp;D spell level(s) Initiate0 (cantrips), Level 1 ApprenticeLevel 2, Level 3 AdeptLevel 4, Level 5 MasterLevel 6, Level 7 GrandmasterLevel 8, Level 9 12.2. Duration Spells may have an instant effect i.e. causing damage, while some may have a continuous effect on the target, for a predefined amount of turns / skill level. Forexample, the spell Light, which it casts on caster himself, provides lighting for 24 turns / skill level. One (1) turn is equivalent to the following: • • • 1 minute (on a party move) 1 minute (on a combat turn) 5 minutes (on a resting turn) 12.3. Capped effect by level Some spells are using the caster's expertise level for their effect. These spells have a maximum limit of levels based on the expertise's starting level, plus 5 levels. If the caster has more than expertise's level plus 5 levels, the level used is limited to this number. Check the following formula: expertise_level = (expertise_level &gt; starting_expertise_level + 5 ? starting_expertise_level + 5 : expertise_level) In game context, the starting expertise level can be easily computed if developer gives an index of 0..n to expertise i.e. Initiate = 0, Apprentice = 1 etc. Therefore, the starting expertise level can be computed with the following formula: starting_expertise_level = (expertise * 5) NOTE: Since monsters do not have an expertise level, their level is used instead. The following formula does this, shrinking the monster's level by 4 to normalize high levels: monster_expertise_level = (monster_level / 4) 12.4. Casting a spell as a non spell-caster There are cases where a character can cast a spell without being a spell- caster or simply not knowing the skill at all. One of such cases is casting a spell from a Wand or a Scroll, which doesn’t take professions into account. In this case, the character may not have the skill of the spell contained in the wand, therefore his expertise level is simply zero (0). In such cases, the non-caster’s skill level becomes one (1). skill_level = (skill_level == 0 || not_caster ? 1 : skill_level)12.5. List Spells are the primary weapons of caster professions, such as Wizards &amp; Clerics. They’re sorted into the element they’re drawing their power from, by which profession(s) can be used, the expertise level that is required and such. Wherever a level is mentioned, the caster’s skill level is considered, not the caster’s level.

<li>Starting equipment &amp; Spells At the start of adventuring, the party characters require some basic equipment to get going, without getting killed in minutes. For spell casters, they’re supposed to know some spells as well. The chosen Profession and Skills are used to define the character’s starting equipment. The following tables provides a list of starting equipment, based on each character’s properties:</li>

<p>13.1. By Profession Professions may define a starting set of equipment. The following table lists all professions and the equipment they give to starting-out characters: Profession Starting equipment Knight Helmet, Boots Cleric Robe, Boots Wizard Robe, Boots</p>
<p>13.2. By Skill The items &amp; spells the character starts with are based primarily on starting Skills.
